# Security Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Security Review

### Smart Contract Security

- [x] Access control implemented
- [x] Reentrancy guards in place
- [x] Integer overflow protection (Solidity 0.8+)
- [x] Input validation on all functions
- [x] Custom errors for gas efficiency
- [x] Event logging for critical operations
- [ ] External audit completed
- [ ] Bug bounty program launched

### Code Quality

- [x] Follows Solidity style guide
- [x] NatSpec documentation complete
- [x] Code commented appropriately
- [x] No hardcoded values
- [x] Constants properly defined
- [x] Libraries used efficiently

### Testing

- [x] Unit tests for all functions
- [x] Integration tests for workflows
- [x] Edge case testing
- [x] Gas optimization tests
- [x] Security-focused tests
- [ ] Fuzzing tests
- [ ] Formal verification

### Access Control Matrix

| Contract | Function | Required Role | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------|
| VaultManager | createVault | Anyone | Public function |
| VaultManager | closeVault | Owner only | Vault owner |
| TimelockVault | scheduleUnlock | VAULT_MANAGER_ROLE | Admin function |
| HeirPolicy | setHeirPolicy | Anyone | Limited by ownership |
| ProofOfLife | checkIn | Owner only | Vault owner |
| OracleBridge | fulfillCondition | Oracle only | Trusted oracle |

### Known Risks

#### Timestamp Dependence
- **Risk**: Miners can manipulate timestamp slightly
- **Mitigation**: Use block numbers as additional check
- **Impact**: Low (< 15 minutes variance)

#### Oracle Failure
- **Risk**: Oracle may not respond
- **Mitigation**: Fallback unlock mechanism
- **Impact**: Medium

#### Gas Price Volatility
- **Risk**: High gas costs during execution
- **Mitigation**: L2 deployment, gas limits
- **Impact**: Low

### Deployment Security

- [ ] Private keys stored securely
- [ ] Multi-sig for admin functions
- [ ] Deployment scripts reviewed
- [ ] Network configuration verified
- [ ] Gas limits appropriate
- [ ] Contract addresses documented

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Contracts verified on Etherscan
- [ ] Role assignments completed
- [ ] Test transactions successful
- [ ] Monitoring systems active
- [ ] Emergency response plan ready
- [ ] Documentation updated with addresses

## Security Monitoring

### Daily Checks
- Vault creation rate
- Unlock execution success rate
- Failed transaction analysis
- Gas usage trends

### Weekly Review
- Access control logs
- Unusual patterns
- User reports
- Oracle reliability

### Monthly Audit
- Complete event log review
- Security incident summary
- Performance metrics
- User feedback analysis

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels

**Critical**: Funds at risk
- Response time: < 1 hour
- Actions: Pause contracts, notify users, investigate

**High**: Functionality broken
- Response time: < 4 hours
- Actions: Deploy fix, notify users

**Medium**: Degraded service
- Response time: < 24 hours
- Actions: Monitor, plan fix

**Low**: Minor issues
- Response time: < 1 week
- Actions: Log, schedule fix

### Response Team
- Technical Lead
- Security Expert
- Community Manager
- Legal Advisor (if needed)

## Emergency Procedures

### Contract Pause
```solidity
await contract.pause();
```

### User Communication
1. Status page update
2. Social media announcement
3. Email notification
4. Discord/Telegram alert

### Recovery
1. Identify root cause
2. Develop fix
3. Test thoroughly
4. Deploy patch
5. Resume operations
6. Post-mortem report

## Compliance

### Legal Requirements
- [ ] Terms of service
- [ ] Privacy policy
- [ ] AML/KYC considerations
- [ ] Jurisdiction research

### Operational
- [ ] Backup systems
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan
- [ ] Insurance coverage
- [ ] Legal entity structure

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Use hardware wallets
- Verify contract addresses
- Test with small amounts
- Keep recovery information secure

### For Developers
- Follow least privilege principle
- Regular security training
- Code review all changes
- Keep dependencies updated

### For Admins
- Multi-sig for critical operations
- Time-locked governance
- Regular access audits
- Incident drills

## Audit Trail

All security-relevant events are logged:
- Vault creation/closure
- Heir configuration changes
- Asset deposits/distributions
- Access control modifications
- Emergency actions

## Reporting Security Issues

**DO:**
- Email security@chronoverse.io
- Provide detailed description
- Include reproduction steps
- Give time for fix before disclosure

**DON'T:**
- Create public GitHub issues
- Discuss publicly before fix
- Exploit vulnerabilities
- Share with others before disclosure
