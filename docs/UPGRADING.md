# Upgrading Guide

## Version Management

Chronoverse contracts are currently deployed as immutable contracts. This guide provides strategies for handling upgrades and migrations.

## Current Version: 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes from 0.x (N/A - Initial Release)

No previous versions exist.

## Upgrade Strategies

### 1. Migration to New Contracts

If significant changes are needed:

**Steps:**
1. Deploy new contract versions
2. Announce migration period
3. Provide migration tools
4. Support both versions temporarily
5. Deprecate old contracts

**User Actions:**
- Create new vaults in new contracts
- Existing vaults remain in old contracts until unlock
- Optionally migrate unlocked vaults

### 2. Proxy Pattern (Future)

For future versions, consider:
- UUPS proxy pattern
- Time-locked governance
- Multi-sig admin control

## Compatibility Matrix

| Contract | Version | Compatible With |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| VaultManager | 1.0.0 | All v1.x |
| TimelockVault | 1.0.0 | All v1.x |
| HeirPolicy | 1.0.0 | All v1.x |

## Data Migration

### Exporting Vault Data

```javascript
const vaultData = await vaultManager.getVault(vaultId);
const heirs = await heirPolicy.getHeirs(vaultId);
const secret = await secretVault.getSecret(vaultId);

// Save for migration
const exportData = {
    vaultId,
    vault: vaultData,
    heirs,
    secret
};
```

### Importing to New Contracts

```javascript
// Create new vault in upgraded contracts
const newVaultId = await newVaultManager.createVault(...);

// Configure heirs
await newHeirPolicy.setHeirPolicy(newVaultId, ...);

// Store secrets
await newSecretVault.storeSecret(newVaultId, ...);
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback

If critical issues are discovered:

1. **Pause New Contracts**
   ```solidity
   await newContract.pause();
   ```

2. **Announce Rollback**
   - Notify all users
   - Provide rollback timeline
   - Explain reasons

3. **Migrate Back**
   - Reverse migration process
   - Verify all data
   - Resume operations

## Testing Upgrades

### On Testnet

1. Deploy new contracts
2. Migrate test vaults
3. Verify functionality
4. Test edge cases
5. Measure gas changes

### Mainnet Fork Testing

```bash
npx hardhat node --fork https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
# Run migration scripts
# Verify results
```

## Communication Plan
